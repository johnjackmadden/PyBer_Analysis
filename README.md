# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate a large data set for an uber-like company in order to spot any trends present across various types of areas, defined as urban, suburban, and rural for the purpose of this exercise. Being able to see trends in large data sets will allow us to spot places that would allow optimal changes to be made in order to make improvements to the company, in this case being money. However, other resources like time and manpower could also be derived from similar data in order to see what is working or to make changes for the overall health of the company
## Results:
### ![pyber](/Resources/PyBer_Challenge.png)
### The overall results of the ride-share data show a similar trend, where Urban has the highest number of total rides, total drivers, followed by suburban, and then rural in these categories. The average fare/ride and average fare/driver shows an opposite trend, where rural is the highest followed by suburban and finally rural. These results are fairly predictable, since it makes sense that with urban communities having a higher population compared to rural and suburban communities they would be providing more rides with more drivers for more people, creating more revenue. Likewise, rural having a highest average fare is also logical since in a rural setting the drive time would be longer than in an urban environment, where a typical ride would be quicker, resulting in a lower fare on average
## Summary:
### In Summary, there are several reasonable explanations for why the disparity exists between urban, suburban, and rural communities and the revenue they generate for the company. Demographics, income distribution, population density and demand are all much higher for Urban areas compared to Rural areas, so there are a few potential directions to take the company in order to accommodate the current constraints
### * Offer incentives for people that live in rural and suburban communities to use the service more often. The most logical application for this would be to encourage people to use the service when they go out to bars and breweries in order to mitigate alcohol-related driver incidents, and these locales are still present outside of urban environments
### * Double down on urban development. Since most fares are from urban communities where the services are needed/used the most, encouraging growth in this sector of the company would show the greatest returns for investment.
### * Open new routes of development: Potentially using other modes of transportation like bikes or scooters would create another point of contact for people that need transportation, but not necessarily a car or rideshare. This would make the most sense in Urban settings, but can potentially be applied in suburban settings as well.
